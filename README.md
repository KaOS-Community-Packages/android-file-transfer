# Android File Transfer
Android File Transfer for Linux — a reliable MTP client with minimalistic UI similar to Android File Transfer.  It just works™.

### Do I need it?

If you're happy with `gmtp`/`gvfs`/`mtpfs` or any other MTP software, you might not need this software (but give it a try!).

If you're suffering from crashes, missing tags, album covers, USB freezes, and corrupted files however, this software is right for you.
